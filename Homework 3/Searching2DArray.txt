I assume that the columns are sorted, but the rows are not. This is an example of such array:

1	5	2
5	7	3
8	9	15
19	30	27

In this case it will be best to perform binary search on every column. With the complexity of binary search being O(log n) and cycling through all columns - O(m) the complexity of the algorithm should be O(m * log n)
